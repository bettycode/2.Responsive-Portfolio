# 2.Responsive-Portfolio

Hello, 

My name is Bethelem Balcha and this is the description for my Responsive Portfolio.


The steps I took to make this responsive portfolio website:-

1. I created my files :index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

2. Using Bootstrap I was able to create the lay out of the pages.
       

	- In my index.html page I used :-
		
		* Navbar layout 
		* Containers
		* Rows
		* Columns and 	
		* Link
		* icons
	
	- The next page is portfolio.html page.
		
		* In this page I used the same layout for navbar, footer and background but the main section contains
	 	 "Cards" that creates beautiful responsive gallery layouts.


	- The last page is contact.html Page .


		* I used similar layout for this page as well. This page used "Forms", that is 
		  the main difference from the other pages. 
		* It also contains links, button and Icons.

3. Next I created style.css for each page. I didn't want to have one big CSS file. In the CSS files i added margins, padding, color, 

   background, media queries and other elements that would make the page great. 


   Thank you!
