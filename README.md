In this Responsive Portfolio, I tried to showcase what am able to do . I focused more on developing  the website.

Directions

The steps I took to make this responsive portfolio website:-

	* I created index.html page, portfolio.html page and contact.html page.

	* Using Bootstrap I was able to create Navbar, containers, rows, columns, buttons and links.      

	* I made sure all my pages have consistent Navbar and Footer.
	
	*  In the portfolio page I added "cards" which created responsive gallery layout.
 
	* In the contact page I created "Form" using Bootstrap. I have also included links, button, Icons .

	* I styled the pages using style.css. I used separate styling pages, I didn't want to have one big CSS file.  
	
	* I used media queries and other elements that would make the page responsive and work on mobile . 

	* I validated my work using w3 website.

	* I made sure all pages and links work the way they should.
